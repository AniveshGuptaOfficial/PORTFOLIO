## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AniveshGuptaOfficial/Anivesh-Gupta-Portfolio.git
   cd Anivesh-Gupta-Portfolio
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to view the portfolio.
   - No server is required as this is a static site, but a local server can enhance testing (see below).

3. **Optional: Use a Local Server**:
   - Install a simple server like `live-server` via npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -g live-server
     live-server
     ```
   - This will open the site in your default browser with live reloading.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure an internet connection is available, as the project uses CDN links for Font Awesome and Google Fonts.
   - Alternatively, download these resources and update the paths in `index.html` for offline use.

## Usage

- **Navigation**: Use the top navbar to jump to different sections (About, Skills, Projects, Certificates, Contact).
- **Skills**: View proficiency levels via progress bars (note: some skills are at 0%, indicating ongoing learning).
- **Projects**: Click "View Project" links to explore live demos (e.g., VTrade) or check the status of in-progress work.
- **Certificates**: Inspect earned certifications with accompanying images.
- **Contact**: Fill out the form to reach out (currently static; backend integration needed for functionality).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m "Add your message"`).
4. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

## Future Enhancements

- Add JavaScript (`script.js`) for interactivity (e.g., form submission, smooth scrolling).
- Implement a backend (e.g., Node.js, PHP) for the contact form.
- Expand the projects section with more completed works.
- Update skill percentages as expertise grows.
- Add more certificates with proper placeholders replaced.
